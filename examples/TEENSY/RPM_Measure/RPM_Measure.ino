   For Teensy boards

   Now even you use all these new 16 ISR-based timers,with their maximum interval practically unlimited (limited only by
   unsigned long miliseconds), you just consume only one Hardware timer and avoid conflicting with other cores' tasks.
   The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
   Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
   This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

   Notes:
   Special design is necessary to share data between interrupt code and the rest of your program.
   Variables usually need to be "volatile" types. Volatile tells the compiler to avoid optimizations that assume
   variable can not spontaneously change. Because your function may change variables while your program is using them,
   the compiler needs this hint. But volatile alone is often not enough.
   When accessing shared variables, usually interrupts must be disabled. Even with volatile,
   if the interrupt changes a multi-byte variable between a sequence of instructions, it can be read incorrectly.
   If your data is multiple variables, such as an array and a count, usually interrupts need to be disabled
   or the entire sequence of your code which accesses the data.

   RPM Measuring uses high frequency hardware timer 1Hz == 1ms) to measure the time from of one rotation, in ms
   then convert to RPM. One rotation is detected by reading the state of a magnetic REED SW or IR LED Sensor
   Asssuming LOW is active.
   For example: Max speed is 600RPM => 10 RPS => minimum 100ms a rotation. We'll use 80ms for debouncing
   If the time between active state is less than 8ms => consider noise.
   RPM = 60000 / (rotation time in ms)

   We use interrupt to detect whenever the SW is active, set a flag then use timer to count the time between active state
